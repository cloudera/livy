 *  A handle to a submitted job. Allows for monitoring and controlling of the running remote job.

 *  @constructor Creates a ScalaJobHandle.

 *
 *  @define multipleCallbacks
 *  Multiple callbacks may be registered; there is no guarantee that they will be
 *  executed in a particular order.
 *
 *  @define nonDeterministic
 *  Note: using this method yields nondeterministic dataflow programs.
 *
 *  @define callbackInContext
 *  The provided callback always runs in the provided implicit
 *` ExecutionContext`, though there is no guarantee that the
 *  `execute()` method on the `ExecutionContext` will be called once
 *  per callback or that `execute()` will be called in the current
 *  thread. That is, the implementation may run multiple callbacks
 *  in a batch within a single `execute()` and it may run
 *  `execute()` either immediately or asynchronously.
