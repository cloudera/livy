  * This enum defines Livy's API versions.
  * [[com.cloudera.livy.server.AbstractApiVersioningSupport]] uses this enum to perform API version checking.
  *
  * Version is defined as <major version>.<minor version>.
  * When a backward compatible change is made to the API (e.g. adding a new method/field), minor version is bumped.
  * When a backward incompatible change is made (e.g. renaming or removing a method/field), major version is bumped.
  * This scheme ensures our user can safely migrate to a newer version if thereâ€™s no change in major version.
